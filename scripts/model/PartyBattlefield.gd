## Weird but convenient way to make the coordinates map with the tile ids.
## Each player has the same set of ids, so we just need to retrieve ids from the other side based on their position.
## It's symmetrical so we don't care which player needs the information, we just need the ids.
## The (0, 0) tile is at the top left (tile id 3 of first player)
